## Assignment 1.01 - Dungeon Generation

## SETUP

Run 'make' inside the trettin_benjamin.assignment-1.03 directory to build the project.

## Running Source Code

The dungeon game can only be run using the ./run command with the --nummon switch. The switch includes a value for the number of monsters to be generated.

EXAMPLE:   ./run --nummon 10

The source code is located inside of the map.c, heap.c, monster.c and dungeonGame.c files.

## Notes

The CHANGELOG file shows all of my commits for this project up to this point.
